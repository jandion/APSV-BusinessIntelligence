    "In this case the output is a class or a label, so we can't calculate the error, instead we will calculate a ratio between the number of times that the output is correct and another count of the outputs, the total number or the number of wrong outputs for example. For example, the most intuitive way to evaluate a classification model is the accuracy : How many times my model guess the correct answer over all the anwsers?. But, even if this can be useful in some cases, in practice, it is not an informative measure.\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, it is a matrix where columns represent the true class and rows represent the output class. With it we can know how many samples have been correctly classified and which classes can be confused.\n",

    "In the case of binary classification, the matrix has only 2 columns and 2 rows, and each of the cells has a proper name.\n",

    "1. Precision: the ratio between positive predicted and the total of positive samples $\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$\n",
    "2. Accuracy: the ratio of correctly predicted over the total of samples $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$\n",
    "3. Recall: the ratio of correctly predicted over all predicted as positive $\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$\n",
    "4. F1 score: harmonic mean of precision and recall $\\frac{Precision*Recall}{Precision+Recall}=\\frac{2*TP}{2*TP+FP+FN}$\n",
